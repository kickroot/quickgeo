## QuickGeo
### An awesome in-memory global postal code database for the dangerously pragmatic Java developer

**What does that even mean?** Rather than give you a dry feature list, let's quickly examine the types of questions that QuickGeo can answer for you:

1. How many miles (or kilometers) is New York City from London?
2. Show me all cities/towns/villages within 25 miles (or kilometers) of Reykjavik, Iceland
3. Show me all cities/towns/villages that match the regex ".*toronoto.*"
4. What cities/town/villages have the postal code "18431"?
5. Give me a bounding box for 29 miles (or kilometers) around New Delhi, India
